<!--TASK:
  Edit Assignment 1 sites to include:
    1) HEADING SIZES- Proper use of heading sizes for visual hierarchy.
    2) SEMANTIC STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS- <header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, <figure>, etc.
      A) Create a <header> with a TITLE (h1 heading size), some one-liner text about the site (with <p>), and a <nav> that includes the links to the pages of your site (index/ homepage, about, Wordpress). THIS SHOULD BE ON EVERY PAGE!
      B) Re-position the content of your page to fit within different semantic structural elements. Use <main>, <section>, etc. EVERY page should use this structure and organization!
      C) Add captions to your photo gallery pages (EACH ONE) by using the <figure> and <figcaption> elements.
    3) NON-SEMANTIC STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS- <div> and <span>
      A) Add <div> and <span> containers where you think could be necessary for later formatting.
      B) Make sure to include the "class" and/or "id" attributes!
    4) Add in some basic formatting/ organizational elements. Use elements like <br>, <hr>, and text formatting (<u>, <i>, <strong>, <em>, <small>, etc.) to add some visual appeal and make your content easier to read and follow.
    5) If stuck, review materials posted to Bb and/or Professor Page's code!
