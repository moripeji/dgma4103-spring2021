<!--Let's take a look at HTML document structure and semantic, structural elements. These elements are designed to contain and house OTHER HTML elements, while giving organization and visual hierarchy to our code AND websites.-->

  </head>

<!--First, let's look at structural elements for the body of a webpage.-->
<!--The body element is composed of three structural elements: header, main, and footer-->
  <body>
    <!--First comes the HEADER element. This is found at the TOP of every webpage of the website.
    COPY AND PASTE YOUR HEADER INTO EVERY SINGLE PAGE!
    It usually houses the navigation menu, as well as the ONLY H1 HEADING (the main title of your page!). Can also contain things like a site slogan or an intro line for the website.-->
    <header>
      <h1>Main Title of the Website</h1>
      <p>Catchy slogan, some sort of line about the website/ company/ brand/ etc.</p>
      <!--The navigation element is ALWAYS found in the header, see below.
      There may be another (less important) nav in the footer, but the main navigation is ALWAYS here in the header.
      Use the nav element to house links to ALL the major pages in the site, and to any important external pages elsewhere on the web.
      MUST BE ON EVERY PAGE OF A WEBSITE. COPY AND PASTE THE HEADER!
      Use the nav element ONLY for the MAIN pages/ links on your site.-->
      <!--Navs are created using a few links separated by some visual element or spacing, OR by creating an unordered list of links.-->
