Let's take a look at HTML document structure.

To create WELL-ORGANIZED, WELL-FORMATTED, and MORE READABLE CODE, AND to create a sense of VISUAL HIERARCHY and WELL-ORGANIZED DESIGN on our WEBSITE, we need to use a few things:

1)HTML SEMANTIC STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS: header, main, footer (and many others nested within those elements, like NAV, ARTICLE, SECTION, ASIDE, FIGURE, etc. Used to give SEMANTIC MEANING (tell web browsers AND web developers the meaning behind your code and content) and STRUCTURE/ ORGANIZATION to HTML web pages. Contain and house other elements in HTML pages.

2)HEADINGS: h1 level used for MAIN TITLE OF WEBSITE ONLY. h2-h6 used depending on importance of content. Use to convey the importance of information to our users by using heading sizes effectively. Creates the "visual hierarchy" needed for good web design accessibility.

3)HTML NON-SEMANTIC STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS: div (block-level), span (in-line). Used to divide sections of content on a web page into smaller parts. No MEANING, but VERY helpful for organization and (later) formatting purposes with CSS.

NOTE: Many of the layout/ organization elements will not visually appear any different in our browsers until we add CSS formatting later in the semester. Headings are an exception.
However, our CODE will appear far more organized, and it will save a LOT of time and frustration in the future by organizing our code and document layout NOW before moving into formatting.

<!--First, let's look at structural elements for the body of a webpage.-->
<!--The body element is composed of three structural elements: header, main, and footer-->
  <body>
    <!--First comes the HEADER element. This is found at the TOP of every webpage of the website.
    COPY AND PASTE YOUR HEADER INTO EVERY SINGLE PAGE!
    It usually houses the navigation menu, as well as the ONLY H1 HEADING (the main title of your page!). Can also contain things like a site slogan or an intro line for the website.-->
    <header>
      <h1>Main Title of Your Website</h1>
      <p>Catchy slogan, some sort of line about your site</p>
      <!--The navigation element is ALWAYS found in the header, see below.
      There may be another (less important) nav in the footer, but the main navigation is ALWAYS here in the header.
      Use the nav element to house links to ALL the major pages in the site, and to any important external pages elsewhere on the web.
      MUST BE ON EVERY PAGE OF A WEBSITE. COPY AND PASTE THE HEADER!
      Use the nav element ONLY for the MAIN pages/ links on your site.-->
      <!--Navs are created using a few links separated by some visual element or spacing, OR by creating an unordered list of links.-->

    <br> <!--Creating a break in the page to keep our elements separate-->
    <!--The <main> semantic element is used to house ALL of the content of our webpage.
    This can contain sections, articles, images, paragraphs, videos, music, links, anything at all!
    This is the MAIN SECTION of each webpage.-->
    <!--Many kinds of structural elements can be housed within the <main> element to give a webpage more structure and organization.
    The most common SEMANTIC elements are ARTICLES, SECTIONS, HEADINGS, and ASIDES.
    You can use HEADERS and FOOTERS within these tags, too. They can have their own header and footer elements.-->

      Usually, this is used for blog posts, magazine articles, forum posts, etc.

    <!--TASK:
      Edit Assignment 1 sites to include:
        1) HEADING SIZES- Proper use of heading sizes for visual hierarchy.
        2) SEMANTIC STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS- <header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, <figure>, etc.
          A) Create a <header> with a TITLE (h1 heading size), some one-liner text about the site (with <p>), and a <nav> that includes the links to the pages of your site (index/ homepage, about, Wordpress). THIS SHOULD BE ON EVERY PAGE!
          B) Re-position the content of your page to fit within different semantic structural elements. Use <main>, <section>, etc. EVERY page should use this structure and organization!
          C) Add captions to your photo gallery pages (EACH ONE) by using the <figure> and <figcaption> elements.
        3) NON-SEMANTIC STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS- <div> and <span>
          A) Add <div> and <span> containers where you think could be necessary for later formatting.
          B) Make sure to include the "class" and/or "id" attributes!
        4) Add in some basic formatting/ organizational elements. Use elements like <br>, <hr>, and text formatting (<u>, <i>, <strong>, <em>, <small>, etc.) to add some visual appeal and make your content easier to read and follow.
        5) If stuck, review materials posted to Bb and/or Professor Page's code!
