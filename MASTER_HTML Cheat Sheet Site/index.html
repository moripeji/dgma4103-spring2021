<!--Some helpful HTML / Atom info before we get started...-->

<!--
1)
<!--This is a comment. Users can't see it, and neither can your web browser. This is JUST for you to make notes to yourself throughout your code.-->
<!--Note the syntax for a comment. Less than symbol, exclamation point, dash dash, comment, dash dash, greater than symbol-->

<!--
2)
<!--HTML pages are made of content, controlled and displayed differently by ELEMENTS. ELEMENTS are made of TAGS-- the basic building blocks of HTML.-->
<!--The SYNTAX of an ELEMENT is: <starttag> content </endtag> -->
<!--The SYNTAX of a TAG is: <tagname> (for start tags) AND </tagname> (for end tags). Note the "/" symbol in the end tag. This CLOSES the tag. Don't forget that! -->
<!--Tags always occur in pairs, unless they are self-closing tags (AKA "empty elements"). A good example of this is the <br> or "line break" element/ tag. -->
<!--Different elements (made of different tags) display content DIFFERENTLY on our web page. Which is why there are so many!-->
<!--Some elements give the HTML document a structure and shape. Others communicate info to the web browser. Others display ALL the content for us and a user to see on our page. Others display that content differently.-->

<!--
3)
It doesn't matter how many times you press "enter" on your keyboard as you write HTML pages. Atom doesn't care, and neither does your web browser.
You can
space
your
content
however you like. It will still be read the same way as if it was neatly organized in one line.
Unless you insert elements or tags designed SPECIFICALLY to insert a line break or some padding/ space before and after the content they are displaying, the web browser will smash all content right up against each other on your web page.
-->

<!--Ok. Time to get started. -->

<!--All HTML documents start with a DOCTYPE declaration. This is NOT an element or tag, it is merely a "declaration" statement (like a comment). It lets the BROWSER know what kind of HTML we are using so that our web pages will open and work properly on modern web browsers. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> <!--The HTML element is the parent/ root element to EVERYTHING contained in an HTML document. Contains all elements, tags, content, etc. nested within it.-->
  <head> <!--The head element is where information about your HTML document goes. For the BROWSER to read, not for users to read.-->
    <meta charset="utf-8"> <!--This specifies the character set we want to use on our browsers to display our content. Utf-8 is the default for English alphabet characters.-->
    <title>HTML Cheat Sheet</title> <!--This specifies the TITLE of our web page that will pop up in the web browser's title bar and on tabs in the browser. Will NOT be contained on our actual webpage itself-- that's what headings are for.-->
  </head>
  <body> <!--The body element contains ALL of the content of the HTML page. EVERYTHING that users see, interact with, etc. EVERYTHING goes here.-->
    <!--Headings usually come first in the body element. Let's look at the heading sizes available. Refresh your index.html page opened in the web browser after writing out each!-->
    <h1><u>HTML Cheat Sheet</u></h1>
    <hr>

    <br>

    <h2><u>Testing Headings:</u></h2>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1> <!--The largest heading size.-->
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6> <!--The smallest heading size.-->
    <hr>

    <br>
    <!--Paragraphs come next.-->
    <!--The paragraph element contains blocks of text, structured together and separated from one another by blank lines or indentations.-->
    <!--The paragraph element/ tags do not JUST have to be used for text; you can use the paragraph tags for ANY grouping of related elements (like images, forms, etc.).-->
    <h2><u>Testing Paragraphs:</u></h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph containing only one sentence.</p>
    <p>This is also a paragraph. Notice the spacing placed between these two lines of text? That's because the paragraph tag is known as a "block-level" tag.</p>
    <p>Block-level tags take up ALL the space available to them on the web browser/ screen the web page is being viewed on. They also usually have some "padding" added around them. </p>
    <p>In HTML, "padding" refers to empty space surrounding the element and/or tags being used.</p>
    <hr>

    <br> <!--This is a "line break" element. It mimics hitting "enter" on your keyboard. Notice it doesn't have a closing tag. That's because it's a "self-closing" tag, or "empty" element!-->

    <h2><u>Testing In-Line Tags/ Elements:</u></h2>
    <p>There are also "in-line" tags and elements. These take up ONLY the space absolutely necessary to display the content. </p>
    <p>Usually, these are links, images, and styling/ formatting tags.</p>
    <p>Two of the most common in-line tags are <em>em</em> and <strong>strong</strong>.</p>

    <!--Now, let's take a look at lists.-->
    <br>
    <h2><u>Testing Lists:</u></h2>
    <p>There are three types of lists in HTML: unordered (bullet lists), ordered (numbered lists), and description lists.</p>
    <p>To create an unordered list, you need to use the "ul" element. For each bullet point, you use the "li" (list item) element.</p>
    <!--It's good practice to put a heading over a list when applicable. Not required, but...-->
    <h3><u>Testing Unordered Lists:</u></h3>
    <ul> <!--The "ul" element is what we use to create a bullet list. It stands for "unordered list". -->
      <li>This</li> <!--To get your list to create bullet points, you need to nest some "li" (list item) elements within the "ul" tags.-->
      <li>is</li>
      <li>an</li>
      <li>unordered</li>
      <li>list.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ordered (numbered) lists are created the exact same way. The only difference is the element name. Instead of "ul", we'll use "ol".</p>

    <h3><u>Testing Ordered Lists:</u></h3>
    <ol> <!--The "ol" element is what we use to create a numbered list. It stands for "ordered list".-->
      <li>This</li> <!--Using the "li" (list item) element again to create our NUMBERED list items this time.-->
      <li>is</li>
      <li>an</li>
      <li>ordered</li>
      <li>list.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Description lists are where things get a little more complicated.</p>
    <p>To create a description list, you need the "dl" element (description list). Nested inside that, we need a "dt" element (description term). Nested inside THAT, we need a "dd" element (description definition).</p>
    <h3><u>Testing Description Lists:</u></h3>
      <dl> <!--The "dl" element is what we use to create a description list.-->
        <dt>Dog</dt> <!--The "dt" element is what we use to create the description term.-->
          <dd>A domesticated carnivorous mammal that typically has a long snout, an acute sense of smell, nonretractable claws, and a barking, howling, or whining voice.</dd> <!--The "dd" element creates the description definition.-->
        <dt>Cat</dt>
          <dd>A small domesticated carnivorous mammal with soft fur, a short snout, and retractable claws. It is widely kept as a pet or for catching mice, and many breeds have been developed.</dd>
        <dt>Bird</dt>
          <dd>A warm-blooded egg-laying vertebrate distinguished by the possession of feathers, wings, and a beak and (typically) by being able to fly.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2><u>Testing Links:</h2></u>
      <p>Now, let's try out some links, which will give us our first preview into HTML attributes!</p>
      <!--To create a link in HTML, you need to use the <a> tag. This is because a link is also called an "anchor"-->
      <!--The syntax of a link is <a href="link">Content that links a user somewhere</a>-->
      <a href="https://w3schools.com/">This is a link. Click this to visit the big HTML-learning resource site.</a>
      <!--The above "href" text in the <a> tag is an ATTRIBUTE. Attributes give us some additional information about HTML elements, and they are ALWAYS located in the START TAG for any element they are being used with.-->
      <!--"Href" is used SOLELY for links. It specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. This URL can be local, meaning it goes to another page on your OWN site, OR it can go to some external link somewhere else on the internet.-->
      <!--HTML Links can be ABSOLUTE URLs or RELATIVE URLs. ABSOLUTE URLs are those that take you to a full web address located somewhere else on the internet, like www.something.com.RELATIVE URLs are those that take you to a LOCAL address on the SAME website, like about.html.-->
      <p>Let's try that again.</p>
      <!--Let's create a GROCERY LIST!-->
      <p>If we wanted to link to <a href="grocery.html">another page</a> on our site, how would we do that?</p>
      <!--Create a NEW FILE (in the same HTML Cheat Sheet project folder) called "grocery.html". Let's make a grocery list!-->
      <hr>
      <br>

      <h3><u>Testing Media:</h3></u>
      <p>Now, let's try adding media to our web pages!</p>
      <br>
      <!--The first thing we need to do is make sure all of our media files are in the SAME FOLDER as our web page .html files. So, download the media into your project folders before attempting this.-->

      <!--Let's start with images.-->
      <h3><u>Testing Images:</h3></u>
      <!--To include images on your web page, you ONLY need the <img> start tag-- no need for an end tag-- and a few attributes. The first attribute we need to use is "src", which stands for "source". This tells the browser where to locate the image we want displayed by giving it the name of the file within our project folder.-->
      <img src="bread.jpg">
      <!--The next attribute we need to include is "alt", which stands for "alternative text". This gives the image a caption/ text description of the image when hovered over for people that cannot see it. This also allows a browser to read the image description out loud for those that cannot see.-->
      <img src="bread.jpg" alt="Loaf of white bread"> <!--Note that attributes are within the same tag, no need to separate them in separate tags. -->

      <!--It is good practice to organize your different media types into separate folders within your main project folder. When you do this, the browser won't be able to locate your image (or media type) by filename alone. Move these images to a folder called "images". THEN, change the img src to this: -->
      <img src="images/bread.jpg" alt="Loaf of white bread">
      <!--You can also go UP a folder if you needed to by typing ../ before the name of the image. See the example below.-->
      <img src="../eggs.jpg" alt="Eggs"> <!--This image is stored in the folder one level UP from my project folder. The web browser is able to access it because of the way I wrote the syntax with that "../"-->

      <!--We can also alter the size of the images using the "style" or "width" and "height" attributes.-->

      <!--Let's try style first. See below.-->
      <img src="images/bread.jpg" alt="Loaf of white bread" style="width:500px; height:500px;">
      <!--For "style" to work properly, you need to follow the above syntax exactly. Put a SEMICOLON after the width; and a SEMICOLON after the height;-->
      <!-- The syntax for style is: style="width:size;height:size;" -->
      <br>
      <!--Now, let's try the same thing, but this time, we'll use the "height" and "width" attributes-->
      <img src="images/bread.jpg" alt="Loaf of white bread" width="500" height="600">
      <!--The width and the height attributes ALWAYS define the dimensions of an image in PIXELS, so there is no need to specify the unit of measurement.-->
      <br>
      <!--Let's add audio to our pages now!-->
      <h3><u>Testing Audio:</u></h3>
      <!--To add audio (music, sound effects, etc.) to your site, use the <audio> tag and the <source> tag together-->
      <audio controls> <!--start with the audio tag. add the word "controls" to allow users to control (play, pause, etc. the music)-->
        <source src="audio/grocerystoresound.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> <!--Add the source tag nested inside to specify the location of the audio file, followed by the src attribute. THEN, add the "type" for the browser to understand what type of audio file we're using. Mp3 file type is always audio/mpeg.-->

        <!--We can also add ANOTHER source, just in case a web browser is NOT compatible with Mp3 files. Some browsers (very rare) only use .ogg files. The type for ogg files is "ogg".-->
        <source src="audio/grocerystoresound.ogg" type="audio/ogg">

        <!--Web browsers are smart enough to know to choose between the two sources, so ALWAYS try to have BOTH mp3 AND ogg files available when using audio files on your site!-->
      </audio>


      <!--Repeat this process with the list items on your grocery list! Add the images within the "li" tags!-->
